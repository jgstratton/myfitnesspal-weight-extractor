# myfitnesspal-weight-extractor

MyFitnessPal requires a premium membership to download your historical data. If you have years of weight data in MyFitnessPal and want to extract it without buying a membership, this little chrome extension will scrape the data out of their website and save it to a csv file (works as of August 2022).
